I am a good modder but very bad with ideas. So here is my solution, have the forums to give me suggestions for the mods they what. That means you, you give me ideas and  I’ll code them for you and share links to the public. It gives you what you what and gives me experience. I will only make your mod of you read and summit according to the registry below. All mods will have a download link in this post so others can enjoy.

Hey guy I here with a new idea, do you see that poll above? I am using it to pick which of the mods you submitted I should spend more time on and release earlier. Vote away.

*^* MAKE SURE YOUR MOD DOES NOT ALREADY EXISTS OR I CAN'T MAKE IT, try using Google to find a similar  mod first *^*

Registry:
Mod Name: Example Craft
When Do I What It By: About a Year
Main Mod Idea: Gives an example to people on what to summit and craft dirt to diamonds
Forge?: Yes/No/Don't care/Modloader Only!
SMP?: Yes Multi-Player/Single Player Only
* Note if you what SMP i need to use forge, that how it works.
If you what you can include any sprites or block side textures you what and they must be 16x16 pixels
If you what to make a recipe for certain items in your suggestions go to http://minecraftrecipedesigner.com/  To Create your own recipes and post the images.
